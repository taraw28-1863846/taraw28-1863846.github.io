  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I was born in Hannover, Germany and, since my mom is German and my dad is American,<br>
    I have dual citizenship. I lived in Germany for about 2 years after I was born, and<br>
    then my parents moved my sister and I to New Zealand for another 2 years. After that, we<br>
    went back to Germany for a year before moving to Venice, Florida for 12 years. My parents<br>
    have always loved traveling and I have definitely inherited that trait. I have explored<br>
    various regions of the USA; Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana are some of my favorites.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently a Sophomore at UW. I am an intended CSE major however I am seriously<br>
    considering becoming a Linguistics major as I love languages. I am currently somewhat<br>
    fluent in German and intend to start learning ASL next school year. This quarter, I am taking<br>
    INFO 101 (Social Networking), CSE 154 (Web Programming) and PHIL 120 (Introduction
    to Logic).<br>
