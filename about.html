      <h1>Tara Wueger</h1>
      <p>
        I was born in Hannover, Germany and, since my mom is German and my dad is American,
        I have dual citizenship. I lived in Germany for about 2 years after I was born, and
        then my parents moved my sister and I to New Zealand for another 2 years. After that, we
        went back to Germany for a year before moving to Venice, Florida for 12 years. My parents
        have always loved traveling and I have definitely inherited that trait. I have explored
        various regions of the USA; Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana are some of my favorites.

            "Tell me and I forget,<br>
            teach me and I remember,<br>
            involve me and I learn."
